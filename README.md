# MOL
Auto generation of Monthly order list - using 4 files (MOL, and 3 other mapping files)


We will need 4 kind of files in order to get the script running and generate the final report

1. MOL File - this will be in CSV format generated by either AVBO system or sent by Data team
2. E-wallet mapping file - this file is maintained daily by our FAT team, which the final version will be always available on Gsheet
3. Mapping file - Merchant X Program name mapping to return values of Payment type and Revenue booked by. This file is mostly static but should there be any changes we will 
the Gsheet
4. Status Mapping - combination of Item X Order X Transaction status to return if we need to Accept, Decline or Recheck the transaction. Will be made available in Gsheet.
